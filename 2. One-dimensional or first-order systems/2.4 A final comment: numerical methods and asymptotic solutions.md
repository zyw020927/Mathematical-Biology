The primary disadvantage of numerical schemes is that they can generate a solution only for **a single set of parameters at a time**.   
Often, especially for biological problems, one would like to explore the dependence of the solution on the parameters that appear in the model, but sweeping the parameter space with a numerical method can be **time consuming**
