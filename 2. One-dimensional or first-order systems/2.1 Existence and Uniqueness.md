In constructing a model, it is often useful to know whether it is well-posed and you can be guaranteed the existence of a unique solution.  
  
**Existence and Uniqueness Theorem**  
Consider the initial value problem. Suppose that $f(x)$ and $f′(x)$ are continuous on an open interval $R$ of the x-axis, and suppose that $x_0$ is a point in $R$.  
Then the initial value problem has a solution $x(t)$ on some time interval $(−τ, τ)$ about $t = 0$, and the solution is unique.
