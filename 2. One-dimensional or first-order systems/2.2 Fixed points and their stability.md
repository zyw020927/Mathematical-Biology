# Introduction
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$$
As will often be the case for nonlinear systems, we will **not be able to find analytical solutions to the equations** and we will have to resort to other means to analyse their behaviour.  
One approach is to identify particular values of $x$ and ascertain **whether the solution will move toward these values** as $t → ∞$, or whether it will move away from them, even if the initial value, $x_0$, is arbitrarily close.  

# Fixed points
$$f(X)=0$$


# Linear stability analysis
By Taylor expansion, $$f(x) = f(x^∗) + (x − x^∗)f^′(x^∗) + h.o.t$$
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = (x − x^∗)f′(x^∗)$$
$$\frac{dη}{dt} = f′(x^∗)η$$
$f^′(x^∗) > 0$, then the perturbation $η$ will grow exponentially with time. This means that $x∗$ is an unstable fixed point   
$f^′(x^∗) < 0$, then the perturbation $η$ will decay exponentially with time. In this case, $x∗$ is a stable fixed point  
$f^′(x^∗) = 0$, need to examine higher-order terms  

As $f(x) = \frac{dx}{dt}$, $f(x)>0$ means change along the $x-axis$, $f(x)>0$ means change in the opposite direction to the $x-axis$  
note that in this case $x-axis$ is not always horizontal
