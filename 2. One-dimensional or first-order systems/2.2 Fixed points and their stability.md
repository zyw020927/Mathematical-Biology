# Introduction
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$$
As will often be the case for nonlinear systems, we will **not be able to find analytical solutions to the equations** and we will have to resort to other means to analyse their behaviour.  
One approach is to identify particular values of $x$ and ascertain **whether the solution will move toward these values** as $t → ∞$, or whether it will move away from them, even if the initial value, $x_0$, is arbitrarily close.  

# Fixed points
$$f(X)=0$$

# Linear stability analysis
By Taylor expansion, $$f(x) = f(x∗) + (x − x∗)f′(x∗) + h.o.t$$
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = (x − x∗)f′(x∗)$$
$$\frac{dη}{dt} = f′(x∗)η$$
$f′(x∗) > 0$, then the perturbation $η$ will grow exponentially with time. This means that $x∗$ is an unstable fixed point   
$f′(x∗) < 0$, then the perturbation $η$ will decay exponentially with time. In this case, $x∗$ is a stable fixed point  
$f′(x∗) = 0$, need to examine higher-order terms  

# Bifurcations
how these fixed points and their stabilities change as we vary parameters that appear in the function $f(x)$.    
When changes in the parameter values lead to **qualitative changes in the fixed points** and their **stability**,   
we say a bifurcation has occurred. The parameter values at which we see the bifurcation is called the **bifurcation point**.

### Saddle-node bifurcation
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = r +x^2$$
$$\frac{dc}{dt} = r - x^2$$

### Transcritical bifurcation
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = rx - x^2$$
