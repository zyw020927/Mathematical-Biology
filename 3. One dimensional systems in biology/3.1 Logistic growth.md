One of the most classical applications of mathematics in biology is **population dynamics**, where the
model is intended to predict the growth or decay of a population of organisms (we’ll get to which
ones in a bit) over time  

# Exponential growth
assumption:  
1. the population is already sufficiently large that stochastic fluctuations in organism numbers are small relative to the size of the population
2. closed population: changes in the population size can only occur through birth and death  
2.1 birth rate: the number of birth is proportional to the number of organisms: if the population size at time $t$ is $x(t)$, then the number of new births that occur over from time $t$ to $t + τ$ is approximately $bxτ$ , where $b ≥ 0$ is the (constant) **per capita birth rate**.   
2.2 death rate: the number of deaths is proportional to $x(t)$, the number of deaths that occur from time $t$ to $t + τ$ is approximately $µxτ$ , where µ ≥ 0 is the (constant) **per capita death rate**.   

$$x(t + τ) − x(t) = (b − µ)τx + O(τ^2)$$
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = rx$$
where $r = b-\mu$ is the net growth rate.  
the solution is   
$$x(t) =x_0e^{rt}$$
  

# Logistic growth
while populations are often seen to grow exponentially at first, the growth rate changes over time and is seen to decrease as the population size increases  
assumption:  
the growth rate decreases linearly with the population size $r(1 − x/K)$  
where $r > 0$ is the growth rate for very small populations (x ≈ 0) and $K > 0$ is the population size at which the growth rate is zero. 
In this context, $r$ is referred to as the **intrinsic growth rate**, the parameter $K$ is called the **carrying capacity**

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = rx(1-\frac{x}{K})$$
$$x{0} = x_0$$
the solution is   
$$x(t) = \frac{Kx_0}{x_0 + (K-x_0)e^{-rt}}$$

### The logistic equation in epidemiology: SIS model
assumption:  
1. the birth and death rates are equal and both given by $\delta$  
2. all newborns are susceptible  
$S$: the size of **susceptible population**  
$I$: the size of **infective population**  
$N$: the size of **total population**  
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ == $\lambda*\frac{SI}{N}$ ==>  
death <== $\delta *S$ ==    **S** $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ **I**    == $\delta*I$ ==> death  
birth == $\delta *N$ ==>    **S**$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$**I**  
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ <== $\eta*I$ ==
