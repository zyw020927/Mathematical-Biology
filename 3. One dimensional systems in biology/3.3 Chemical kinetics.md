$$A+B\stackrel{k_1}{\rightarrow}C$$
the concentration of the molecules: $a=[A], b=[B], c=[c]$  
**the law of mass action**: the reaction rate is proportional to the product of the concentration of the reactants  
production of c:  $\frac{dc}{dt} = k_{1}*a*b$    
depletion rates:  $\frac{da}{dt} = -k_{1}*a*b$ ,  $\frac{db}{dt} = -k_{1}*a*b$   
$$s_{1j}^{R}X_1 + s_{2j}^RX_2+ ... + s_{nj}^{R}X_n \stackrel{k_j}{\rightarrow}s_{1j}^{P}X_1 + s_{2j}^PX_2+ ... + s_{nj}^{P}X_n$$
$$\frac{dx_i}{dt} = \sum_{j=1}^{r} (s_{ij}^{P} - s_{ij}^{R})*k_j * \prod_{j=1}^{n} x_l^{s^{R{lj}}}$$

# Enzyme dynamics: Michaelis-Menten model
$$S+E \mathop{\leftrightarrows} \limits_{k_{-1}}^{k_1} SE \stackrel{k_2}{\rightarrow} P+E$$
let $c= [SE]$  
$$\frac{dc}{dt} = k_1se - (k_{-1} + k_2)c$$
$$\frac{de}{dt} = -k_1se + (k_{-1} + k_2)c$$
$$\frac{ds}{dt} - -k_1se + k_{-1}c$$
$$\frac{dp}{dt} = k_2c$$
# Nondimensionalisation
$t = \frac{τ}{k1e0}$ , $s = s_0u$ , $c = e_0v$
$$ϵ\frac{dv}{dτ} = u − (u + K)v$$
$$\frac{du}{dτ} = −u + (u + K − λ)v$$
# Quasi-steady approximation
NOTE:  the dynamics are governed by two ODEs  
If the initial concentration of enzyme is small relative to that of the substrate, we have that $ϵ ≪ 1$ and assuming the remaining coefficients are O(1), we can take $ϵ = 0$    
use separation of variables, the solution is obtained: $u + K log u = 1 − λτ$   
In setting $ϵ = 0$ ,we removed the dynamics of v and insisted it must reach its **quasi-steady state** instantaneously.  
In reality, we won’t have $ϵ = 0$, but rather a tiny, finite number, so there will be some dynamic but they will happen very quickly
