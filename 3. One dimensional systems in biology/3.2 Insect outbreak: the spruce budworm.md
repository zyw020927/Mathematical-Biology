assumption:
logistic growth for the budworm population in the absence of birds  

N: the budworm population size  
$p(N)$: the rate of change in the budworm population size due to predation by birds
$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN (1 − \frac{N}{K})− p(N)$$
  
$p(N) = \frac{BN^2}{A^2+N^2}$  
where $B>0$ is the predation rate, $A>0$ provides a measure of the threshold population size where predation suddenly increase

# Nondimensionalisation
nondimensional budworm population size: $x$  
nondimensionalise $N$: $N=Ax$  
  
nondimensional time: $\tau$  
nondimensionalise $t$: $t=\frac{A}{B}\tau$  

$R = r\frac{A}{B}$ and $k=\frac{K}{A}$  
$$\frac{dx}{d\tau} = Rx)1-\frac{x}{k}) - \frac{x^2}{1+x^2}$$

# Fixed points
$$\frac{dx}{d\tau} = 0$$
consider intersection for the curves

# Stability 
The stable fixed points $x^∗ = a$ and $x^∗ = c$ correspond to the **refuge** and **outbreak** population levels, respectively.   
The unstable fixed point $x^∗ = b$ is referred to as the **threshold**,  
as initial populations $x_0 > b$ increase to the outbreak level, while for $x_0 < b$ the population will decrease to the refuge size
