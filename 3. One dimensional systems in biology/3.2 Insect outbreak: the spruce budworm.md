assumption:
logistic growth for the budworm population in the absence of birds  

N: the budworm population size  
$p(N)$: the rate of change in the budworm population size due to predation by birds
$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN (1 − \frac{N}{K})− p(N)$$
  
$p(N) = \frac{BN^2}{A^2+N^2}$  
where $B>0$ is the predation rate, $A>0$ provides a measure of the threshold population size where predation suddenly increase
