**Existence and Uniqueness Theorem**
# Fixed points and their stability
1. A fixed point is said to be **stable** if for any small $δ_1$ there exists a $δ_2$ such that if $||(0) − x^|| <δ_2$ ,  
then the solution exist for all $t > 0$ and $||x(t) − x^|| < δ_1$ for all $t > 0$.
2. A stable fixed point is said to be **asymptotically stable** if any solution $x(t)$ with $x(0)$ near $x^∗$ converges to $x^∗$ as $t → ∞$  
3. A fixed point is **unstable** if is not stable.

**Stability thoerem**  
Let $x^∗$ be a fixed point. If **all** the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $A$ have **negative real parts**, then $x^∗$ is **asymptotically stable**, and $||x(t)−x^|| ≤ const.e^{−µt}$ $(µ > 0)$ for all $t > 0$ if $||x(0)−x^||$ is sufficiently small. If at least one of the eigenvalues has a positive real part, then $x^∗$ is unstable.
