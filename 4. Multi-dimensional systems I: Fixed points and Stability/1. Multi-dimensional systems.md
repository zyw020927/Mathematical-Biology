**Existence and Uniqueness Theorem**
# Fixed points and their stability
1. A fixed point is said to be **stable** if for any small $δ_1$ there exists a $δ_2$ such that if $||(0) − x^|| <δ_2$ ,  
then the solution exist for all $t > 0$ and $||x(t) − x^|| < δ_1$ for all $t > 0$.
2. A stable fixed point is said to be **asymptotically stable** if any solution $x(t)$ with $x(0)$ near $x^∗$ converges to $x^∗$ as $t → ∞$  
3. A fixed point is **unstable** if is not stable.

**Stability thoerem**  
Let $x^∗$ be a fixed point. If **all** the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $A$ have **negative real parts**, then $x^∗$ is **asymptotically stable**, and $||x(t)−x^|| ≤ const.e^{−µt}$ $(µ > 0)$ for all $t > 0$ if $||x(0)−x^||$ is sufficiently small. If at least one of the eigenvalues has a positive real part, then $x^∗$ is unstable.  


# Two dimensional systems: n=2
$$\begin{bmatrix}

$$\lambda_{1,2} = \frac{\tau \pm \sqrt{\tau^2 - 4\delta}}{2}$$
where $τ = trace(A) = a + d$ and $∆ = det(A) = ad − bc$  
The solution is   
$$y(t) = c_1ξ_1e^{λ_1t} + c_2ξ_2e^{λ_2t}$$
Possible cases:  
1. Stable node: $τ^2 − 4∆ > 0$ , and $λ_1 < 0$ , $λ_2 < 0$  
2. Unstable node: $τ^2 − 4∆ > 0$ , and $λ_1 > 0$, $λ_2 > 0$  
3. Saddle point: $τ^2 − 4∆ > 0$ , and $λ_1 > 0$ , $λ_2 < 0$   
4. Stable Star: $τ^2 − 4∆ = 0$ , A is diagonalisable, and $λ_1 = λ_2 < 0$   
5. Unstable Star: $τ^2 − 4∆ = 0$ , A is diagonalisable, and $λ_1 = λ_2 > 0$  
6. Stable spiral: $τ^2 − 4∆ < 0$ , and $Re(λ_1) = Re(λ_2) < 0$  
7. Unstable spiral: $τ^2 − 4∆ < 0$ , and $Re(λ_1) = Re(λ_2) > 0$  
8. Centre: $τ^2 − 4∆ < 0$ , and $Re(λ_1) = Re(λ_2) = 0$

### Phase portraits
1. The **fixed points**  
2. The **closed orbits**. These are solutions that have the property $x(t) = x(t + T)$ for some $T > 0$  
3. The trajectories near fixed points and closed orbits that show the **flow pattern**  
4. Some indication of whether the fixed points or closed orbits are **stable or unstable**
    
**Nullclines**  
The nullclines are the curves where either $\frac{dx1}{dt} = f_1(x_1, x_2) = 0$ , or  $\frac{dx_2}{dt} = f_2(x_1, x_2) = 0$      
the nullclines will intersect at the fixed points
