# SIS model for two interacting populations
### nondimensionalisation
### Nullclines
### Fixed points and their stability
### Interpretation

# Genetic control system
$$\frac{dp}{dt} = k_3m − k_1p$$
$$\frac{dm}{dt} = h_1\frac{p^2}{H^2 + p^2} − k_2m$$
### nondimensionalisation
### Nullclines
### Fixed points and their stability
### Interpretation
bistability indicates that depending on the intial concentrations of the protein and mRNA, protein production will go to zero, or the concentration of protein will be sustained at a level set by the system  


#  Competition between populations
$$\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1N_1(1 − \frac{N_1}{K_1}− b_{12}\frac{N_2}{K_1})$$
$$\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r_2N_2(1 − \frac{N_2}{K_2}− b_{21}\frac{N_1}{K_2})$$

### Fixed points and their stability
### Phase portrait
### Interpretation
A rather striking feature of this model is that 3 of the 4 cases described above result in exinction of one of the species!  
The exinction of one population due to competition with another is known as the principle of competitive exclusion.
