# SIS model for two interacting populations
the **male** population size is $N$ and is split into two subpopulations: the susceptible male population whose size is $S$, and the infective male population whose size is $I$, such that $N = S + I$   
the **female** population size is $N^*$ and is split into two subpopulations: the susceptible male population whose size is $S^*$, and the infective male population whose size is $I^*$, such that $N^* = S^* + I^*$   
ignore changes in the population size due to birth and death, and only consider exchanges between populations due to recovery and infection  
$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -rSI^* + aI$$
$$\frac{dS*}{dt} = -r^*S^*I + a^*I^*$$
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = rSI^* - aI$$
$$\frac{dI*}{dt} = r^*S^*I - a^*I^*$$

### nondimensionalisation
$I = Nu$, where u is the nondimensional male infective population  
$I^∗ = N^∗v$, v is the nondimensional female infective population  
$t = \frac{τ}{a}$, τ is the nondimensional time   
$$\frac{du}{dτ} = Rv(1 − u) − u = f_1(u, v)$$
$$\frac{dv}{dτ} = R^∗u(1 − v) − A^∗v = f_2(u, v)$$
### Nullclines
Setting the right hand sides of our equations equal to zero  
$$v = \frac{u}{R(1 − u)}$$
$$u = \frac{A^∗v}{R^∗(1 − v)}$$
### Fixed points and their stability
The Jacobian for the system is
J(u, v) = [
∂f1/∂u ∂f1/∂v
∂f2/∂u ∂f2/∂v ]
=
[
−Rv − 1 R − Ru
R∗ − R∗v −R∗u − A∗

### Interpretation

# Genetic control system
$$\frac{dp}{dt} = k_3m − k_1p$$
$$\frac{dm}{dt} = h_1\frac{p^2}{H^2 + p^2} − k_2m$$
### nondimensionalisation
### Nullclines
### Fixed points and their stability
### Interpretation
bistability indicates that depending on the intial concentrations of the protein and mRNA, protein production will go to zero, or the concentration of protein will be sustained at a level set by the system  


#  Competition between populations

$$\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1N_1(1 − \frac{N_1}{K_1}− b_{12}\frac{N_2}{K_1})$$
$$\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r_2N_2(1 − \frac{N_2}{K_2}− b_{21}\frac{N_1}{K_2})$$

### Fixed points and their stability
### Phase portrait
### Interpretation
A rather striking feature of this model is that 3 of the 4 cases described above result in exinction of one of the species!  
The exinction of one population due to competition with another is known as the principle of competitive exclusion.

# Predator-Prey systems (Lotka-Volterra system)
the population size of prey: $N(t)$  
the population size of predator: $P(t)$  
$$\frac{dN}{dt} = aN − bNP$$
$$\frac{dP}{dt} = −dP + cNP$$
$+$: producing a model that gives oscillations  
$-$: 1. there is no natural oscillation in the population levels – different initial population sizes yield different oscillations   
$-$: 2. this causes strange, unnatural things to occur, such as lowering the initial population of predators resulting in larger peaks in their population size
