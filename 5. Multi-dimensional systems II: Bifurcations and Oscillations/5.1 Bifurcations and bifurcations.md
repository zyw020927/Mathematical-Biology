# Existence of closed orbits: Poincare-Bendixson Theorem
Suppose that:  
1. $R$ is a closed, bounded subset of the plane  
2. $\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$ is a continuously differentiable vector field on an open set containing $R$  
3. $R$ does not contain any fixed points  
4. There exists a trajectory $C$ that is confined in $R$, meaning that it begins in $R$ and remains in $R$ for all future times
     
Then either $C$ is a closed orbit, or it spirals toward a closed orbit at $t → ∞$

**Nondimensionalisation**

**Nullclines and fixed points**

# Relaxation oscillators

### Fitzhugh-Nagumo model

**Period of the orbit**
