#  Hopf bifurcation in the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model
Suppose that system has a fixed point $x^∗(µ)$ which is a spiral.   
Thus, we can express the eigenvalues of the Jacobian as $λ(µ) = α(µ) ± iω(µ)$ . 
Suppose also that at $µ = µc$ a Hopf bifurcation occurs, where the fixed point changes from being a stable spiral to one that is unstable.   
Thus, at the $µc$, we must have $α(µc) = 0$ .
