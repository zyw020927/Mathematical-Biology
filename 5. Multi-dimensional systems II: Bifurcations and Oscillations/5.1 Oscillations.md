# Existence of closed orbits: Poincare-Bendixson Theorem
Suppose that:  
1. $R$ is a closed, bounded subset of the plane  
2. $\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$ is a continuously differentiable vector field on an open set containing $R$  
3. $R$ does not contain any fixed points  
4. There exists a trajectory $C$ that is confined in $R$, meaning that it begins in $R$ and remains in $R$ for all future times
     
Then either $C$ is a closed orbit, or it spirals toward a closed orbit at $t → ∞$  
### More-realistic predator-prey system

The predator population is taken to follow a **logistic-like** equation  
the **carrying capacity** is proportional to the size of the prey population, rather than simply being a constant.
$$\frac{dN}{dt} = N(r(1 −\frac{N}{K})− k\frac{P}{N + D})$$
$$\frac{dP}{dt} = sP (1 − h\frac{P}{N})$$
